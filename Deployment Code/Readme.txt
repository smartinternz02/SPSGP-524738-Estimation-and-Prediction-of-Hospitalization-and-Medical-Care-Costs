Estimation and Prediction of Hospitalization and Medical Care Costs

Description
This project aims to analyze and understand the factors influencing medical care costs and provide valuable insights using data visualization techniques. By leveraging a comprehensive insurance dataset, we explore the relationships between age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and region with medical charges. Through interactive visualizations and statistical analysis, we uncover patterns, trends, and significant factors impacting healthcare expenses.

Features
-> Interactive dashboards and visualizations
-> Comparative analysis of medical charges based on age, sex, and BMI
-> Exploration of the relationship between smoking and healthcare costs
-> Regional analysis of medical charges and BMI distribution
-> Odds ratio analysis to determine significant factors affecting charges
-> User-friendly interface for easy data exploration and insights
